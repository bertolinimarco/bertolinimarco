# Ciao! 👋

I'm a unique blend of front end developer with 10+ years of work experience, who loves turn design and ideas into clear, scalable and maintenable products. 

👨🏻‍💻 Tech
- Unique tech background: taking my first steps into the world of technology on a 286-PC with MS-DOS and floppy disks. With the advent of the Internet, I was inspecting web page code for the first time on MySpace from a 56k line connected to IRC and MSN. With NotePad.
- I've always preferred Netscape Navigator to Internet Explorer.
- Before CSS frameworks were widely used, I had developed my own set of tools that I used as "best practice" blueprints for web projects. Even today I use a similar tool.

🧙🏻‍♂️ Personality
- I like (and want) to be very organized.
- I'm an INTJ. Although the Meyers-Briggs indicator was considered ["not really reliable."](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-28315137)
- I can play (and have played with several bands throughout northern Italy) guitar, bass and drums, self-taught.
- Since 1999 my passion for the geeky/nerdy world has never left me: over the years I have transmitted to many people this passion and in 2014 I co-founded in Valle Camonica (Italy, BS) the first ludic and cultural association dedicated to the popularization of smart games called "Camunia Ludica.".
- I spend my free time between technology, literature, art, hiking and traveling.
